# python-poetry - A naive poetry generator library for Python 2.x

Currently I've only implemented a generator which uses a static dictionary, based loosely on Taroko Gorge by
Nick Montfort (@nickmontfort). More robust things will come, surely.

## Running
python test.py

## Sample Pastoral

    You weep
    Your warm squirrel unveils the rumble
    A rake orders his flip-flap
    Your rake delves whirrings under a creek

    You reel
    Ladders make clickety-clacks with a cloud
    The tree moves rumbles with my cow
    A cat quells your crackle
        --scream, bite, hunger for a seed

    You stop
    A dim creek ruins the flip-flap
    A cool barn harrows her bleat
    A dry squirrel unveils rumbles for a rabbit
        --bite, seek, scream under his rabbit
