# poetry - A naive poetry generator library for Python 2.x

Currently I've only implemented a generator which uses a static generator, based loosely on Taroko Gorge by
Nick Montfort. More robust things will come, surely.

## Running
python test.py

## Sample Pastoral

    You halt
    A wet bale kicks whisperings into a nest
    Cows unveil his clickety-clacking
    My horse quells crunchings under a dog

    You breathe
    Wrought windmills forget a clip-clopping
    Wrought dogs illumine whirrings for her cabin
    Blue beaver dams take liltings for a hand
        --hunger, strive, thirst toward a bale
